clj-webhook-consumer is simple Clojure server that sets up endpoints for responding to webhooks like those from dockerhub and github. For example, you configure the server to restart a docker container with an updated image when a new image is pushed to dockerhub. It's meant to be the final link in a continuous deployment system.

* Usage
** Create your configuration file 

clj-webhook-consumer uses a configuration file to set up your endpoints.
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  key: your_api_key
  hooks:
    - name: dockerhub
      script: ./new-image-alert.sh
    - name: github
      script: ./repo-pushed-alert.sh
#+END_SRC

This will set up endpoints at ~localhost:3000/dockerhub~ and ~localhost:3000/github~ that will respond to events by running the specified shell script. Only post requests are currently supported.

If you set the environment variable ~CLJ_WEBHOOK_KEY~, then you will need to pass it with your requests as a query parameter:
~https://your-domain/dockerhub?key=your_api_key~

#+begin_warning
If you don't use a key, anyone will be able to trigger your scripts if they know the url
You should not send your key over http
#+end_warning

This server doesn't directly support https, but it's meant to be run behind a reverse proxy (nginx) that does. 

You can also map any json data received from the webhook to environment variables.
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  hooks:
    - name: dockerhub
      script:
        - ./echo-repo-description.sh
        - ./copy-dockerfile.sh
      env:
        repository:
          full_description: FULL_DESCRIPTION
          dockerfile: _
#+END_SRC

This example expects json like the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC json
  {
    "repository": {
       "full_description": "A description of the repository that was pushed to",
       "dockerfile": "The contents of the Dockerfile used for the build"
     }
  }
#+END_SRC

When the scripts run, the environment variables will be set accordingly:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  echo $FULL_DESCRIPTION => "A description of the repository that was pushed to"
  echo $DOCKERFILE => "The contents of the Dockerfile used for the build"
#+END_SRC

** Run the server

Build a standalone jar (or download the latest release)
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./build.sh
#+END_SRC

Run the standalone jar:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
java -jar target/clj-webhook-consumer-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
#+END_SRC

The server will look for your ~.clj-webhook.yaml~ file and scripts in the directory that you run the jar.

* Development
** Run the tests
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
lein test
#+END_SRC
** Run the development server
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
lein run
#+END_SRC
